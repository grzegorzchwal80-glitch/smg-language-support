# smg-language-support README

Hi!
This is a syntax highligher + intellisense extention i made for my programming language SMG, cool eh?
To get it, you need to install it on github by going onto the github account named mangykirb, installing the ZIP and... the other MDs do exist.

## Features

The features here are
Syntax highlighter
Intellisense (broken, ill fix it in a few days :D)

## Requirements

Nothing, u just need the compiler and a linker if u want the executable.
Either way u can use this without a compiler for SMG or a linker

## Extension Settings

None

## Known Issues

Some keywords might not be finished, because they are a WIP. For example, extern (include in SMG) is a HUGE pain because well, just gotta make it so include gets support outside main

## For more information, comment on the SMG-language github repo. if ur lazy, heres the link down below
